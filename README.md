# Multivariate-Analysis-of-Water-Quality-in-Shuangji-River
The Shuangji River is a polluted river in China that receives water from urban waste and papermaking waste processing plants.  Effective waste disposal control is essential to improve water quality, as municipal sewage and industrial wastewater are sustainable sources of pollution.

This analysis was carried out to carry out an in-depth analysis of the variables that form water quality in the Shuangji river.

The initial step was to reduce dimensions using factor analysis to reduce 19 variables considered too many. Next, clustering was carried out to see water quality differences between locations and times. From here, classification modeling was also carried out using discriminant analysis to classify factors into several spatial and temporal groups that had been formed as a result of clustering. In other words, discriminant analysis in this case helps to confirm whether the clustering results are accurate, and at the same time provides further understanding of what factors are most influential in separating water quality groups at various locations and times.
